# Overview
Within this project i am using Count Vectorizer as a vectorizer to do sentiment analysis using 5 machine algorithms such as KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and random forest. My objective is to find the best performing machine algorithm to do this task by using a confusion matrix to see their performance. 

# Dataset Used
The dataset used within this project is women's e-commerce reviews which has over 23.000 datas and 10 variables including outfit ID, age, title, review text, rating, recommended status, positive feedback, division name, department name, and class name from the website Kaggle.

# Conclusion
From this project i have concluded that the best performing machine learning is Naive Bayes with a 88% accuracy and the worst peforming algorithm being KNN for conducting a sentiment analysis with a 71% accuracy.

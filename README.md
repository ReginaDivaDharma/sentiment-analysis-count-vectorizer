# sentimentAnalysisCountVectorizer
Within this project i am using Count Vectorizer to do sentiment analysis using 5 machine algorithms such as KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and random forest. My objective is to find the best performing machine algorithm to do this task by using a confusion matrix to see their performance.
